# Quality Assurance

## In web development, quality can be broken down into three dimensions:

- Reach
  - refers to the market penetration of your product
- Functionality
  - functionality is concerned with functional correctness
- Usability
  - usability evaluates human-computer interaction (HCI)
- Aesthetics

## The Types of Tests

- Page testing
- Cross-page testing
- Logic testing
  - execute unit and integration tests against our logic domain
- Linting
  - it identifies areas that could represent possible errors, or fragile constructs
- Link checking
  - making sure there are no broken links on your site

## Test Runner

- mocha

## Assertion libraray

- chai
- should

## BDD

    - The default interface In mocha
    - you de‚Äêscribe components and their behaviors, and the tests then verify those behaviors

## TDD

    - is more matter-of-fact
    - you describe suites of tests and tests within the suite
